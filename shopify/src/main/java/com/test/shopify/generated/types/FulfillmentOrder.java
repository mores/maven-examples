/**
 * The FulfillmentOrder object represents either an item or a group of items in an
 * [Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)
 * that are expected to be fulfilled from the same location.
 * There can be more than one fulfillment order for an
 * [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order)
 * at a given location.
 *
 * {{ '/api/reference/fulfillment_order_relationships.png' | image }}
 *
 * Fulfillment orders represent the work which is intended to be done in relation to an order.
 * When fulfillment has started for one or more line items, a
 * [Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment)
 * is created by a merchant or third party to represent the ongoing or completed work of fulfillment.
 *
 * [See below for more details on creating fulfillments](#the-lifecycle-of-a-fulfillment-order-at-a-location-which-is-managed-by-a-fulfillment-service).
 *
 * > Note:
 * > Shopify creates fulfillment orders automatically when an order is created.
 * > It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.
 * >
 * > [See below for more details on the lifecycle of a fulfillment order](#the-lifecycle-of-a-fulfillment-order).
 *
 * ## Retrieving fulfillment orders
 *
 * ### Fulfillment orders from an order
 *
 * All fulfillment orders related to a given order can be retrieved with the
 * [Order.fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order#connection-order-fulfillmentorders)
 * connection.
 *
 * [API access scopes](#api-access-scopes)
 * govern which fulfillments orders are returned to clients.
 * An API client will only receive a subset of the fulfillment orders which belong to an order
 * if they don't have the necessary access scopes to view all of the fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ### Fulfillment orders assigned to the app for fulfillment
 *
 * Fulfillment service apps can retrieve the fulfillment orders which have been assigned to their locations with the
 * [assignedFulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/2024-07/objects/queryroot#connection-assignedfulfillmentorders)
 * connection.
 * Use the `assignmentStatus` argument to control whether all assigned fulfillment orders
 * should be returned or only those where a merchant has sent a
 * [fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrderMerchantRequest)
 * and it has yet to be responded to.
 *
 * The API client must be granted the `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope to access
 * the assigned fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ### All fulfillment orders
 *
 * Apps can retrieve all fulfillment orders with the
 * [fulfillmentOrders](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/queries/fulfillmentOrders)
 * query. This query returns all assigned, merchant-managed, and third-party fulfillment orders on the shop,
 * which are accessible to the app according to the
 * [fulfillment order access scopes](#api-access-scopes) it was granted with.
 *
 * ## The lifecycle of a fulfillment order
 *
 * ### Fulfillment Order Creation
 *
 * After an order is created, a background worker performs the order routing process which determines
 * which locations will be responsible for fulfilling the purchased items.
 * Once the order routing process is complete, one or more fulfillment orders will be created
 * and assigned to these locations. It is not possible to manually create fulfillment orders.
 *
 * Once a fulfillment order has been created, it will have one of two different lifecycles depending on
 * the type of location which the fulfillment order is assigned to.
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a merchant managed location
 *
 * Fulfillment orders are completed by creating
 * [fulfillments](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment).
 * Fulfillments represents the work done.
 *
 * For digital products a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfilment once the digital asset
 * has been provisioned.
 * For example, in the case of a digital gift card, a merchant would to do this once
 * the gift card has been activated - before the email has been shipped.
 *
 * On the other hand, for a traditional shipped order,
 * a merchant or an order management app would create a fulfillment after picking and packing the items relating
 * to a fulfillment order, but before the courier has collected the goods.
 *
 * [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as an order management app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/order-management-apps/manage-fulfillments).
 *
 * ### The lifecycle of a fulfillment order at a location which is managed by a fulfillment service
 *
 * For fulfillment orders which are assigned to a location that is managed by a fulfillment service,
 * a merchant or an Order Management App can
 * [send a fulfillment request](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitFulfillmentRequest)
 * to the fulfillment service which operates the location to request that they fulfill the associated items.
 * A fulfillment service has the option to
 * [accept](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderAcceptFulfillmentRequest)
 * or [reject](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderRejectFulfillmentRequest)
 * this fulfillment request.
 *
 * Once the fulfillment service has accepted the request, the request can no longer be cancelled by the merchant
 * or order management app and instead a
 * [cancellation request must be submitted](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderSubmitCancellationRequest)
 * to the fulfillment service.
 *
 * Once a fulfillment service accepts a fulfillment request,
 * then after they are ready to pack items and send them for delivery, they create fulfillments with the
 * [fulfillmentCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentCreate)
 * mutation.
 * They can provide tracking information right away or create fulfillments without it and then
 * update the tracking information for fulfillments with the
 * [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate)
 * mutation.
 *
 * [Learn about managing fulfillment orders as a fulfillment service](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments).
 *
 * ## API access scopes
 *
 * Fulfillment orders are governed by the following API access scopes:
 *
 * * The `read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
 *   `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes
 *   grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations.
 * * The `read_assigned_fulfillment_orders` and `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders`
 *   access scopes are intended for fulfillment services.
 *   These scopes grant access to fulfillment orders assigned to locations that are being managed
 *   by fulfillment services.
 * * The `read_third_party_fulfillment_orders` and `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
 *   access scopes grant access to fulfillment orders
 *   assigned to locations managed by other fulfillment services.
 *
 * ### Fulfillment service app access scopes
 *
 * Usually, **fulfillment services** have the `write_assigned_fulfillment_orders` access scope
 * and don't have the `*_third_party_fulfillment_orders`
 * or `*_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` access scopes.
 * The app will only have access to the fulfillment orders assigned to their location
 * (or multiple locations if the app registers multiple fulfillment services on the shop).
 * The app will not have access to fulfillment orders assigned to merchant-managed locations
 * or locations owned by other fulfillment service apps.
 *
 * ### Order management app access scopes
 *
 * **Order management apps** will usually request `write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders` and
 * `write_third_party_fulfillment_orders` access scopes. This will allow them to manage all fulfillment orders
 * on behalf of a merchant.
 *
 * If an app combines the functions of an order management app and a fulfillment service,
 * then the app should request all
 * access scopes to manage all assigned and all unassigned fulfillment orders.
 *
 * ## Notifications about fulfillment orders
 *
 * Fulfillment services are required to
 * [register](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentService)
 * a self-hosted callback URL which has a number of uses. One of these uses is that this callback URL will be notified
 * whenever a merchant submits a fulfillment or cancellation request.
 *
 * Both merchants and apps can
 * [subscribe](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
 * to the
 * [fulfillment order webhooks](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/WebhookSubscriptionTopic#value-fulfillmentorderscancellationrequestaccepted)
 * to be notified whenever fulfillment order related domain events occur.
 *
 * [Learn about fulfillment workflows](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment).
