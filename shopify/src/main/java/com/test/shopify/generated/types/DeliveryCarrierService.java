/**
 * A carrier service (also known as a carrier calculated service or shipping
 * service) provides real-time shipping rates to Shopify. Some common carrier
 * services include Canada Post, FedEx, UPS, and USPS. The term **carrier** is
 * often used interchangeably with the terms **shipping company** and **rate provider**.
 *
 * Using the CarrierService resource, you can add a carrier service to a shop and
 * then provide a list of applicable shipping rates at checkout. You can even use
 * the cart data to adjust shipping rates and offer shipping discounts based on
 * what is in the customer's cart.
 *
 * ## Requirements for accessing the CarrierService resource
 * To access the CarrierService resource, add the `write_shipping` permission to
 * your app's requested scopes. For more information, see [API access
 * scopes](https://shopify.dev/docs/admin-api/access-scopes).
 *
 * Your app's request to create a carrier service will fail unless the store
 * installing your carrier service meets one of the following requirements:
 * * It's on the Advanced Shopify plan or higher.
 * * It's on the Shopify plan with yearly billing, or the carrier service feature
 * has been added to the store for a monthly fee. For more information, contact
 * [Shopify Support](https://help.shopify.com/questions).
 * * It's a development store.
 *
 * > Note:
 * > If a store changes its Shopify plan, then the store's association with a
 * carrier service is deactivated if the store no long meets one of the
 * requirements above.
 *
 * ## Providing shipping rates to Shopify
 * When adding a carrier service to a store, you need to provide a POST endpoint
 * rooted in the `callbackUrl` property where Shopify can retrieve applicable
 * shipping rates. The callback URL should be a public endpoint that expects these
 * requests from Shopify.
 *
 * ### Example shipping rate request sent to a carrier service
 *
 * ```json
 * {
 *   "rate": {
 *     "origin": {
 *       "country": "CA",
 *       "postal_code": "K2P1L4",
 *       "province": "ON",
 *       "city": "Ottawa",
 *       "name": null,
 *       "address1": "150 Elgin St.",
 *       "address2": "",
 *       "address3": null,
 *       "phone": null,
 *       "fax": null,
 *       "email": null,

 *     },
 *     "items": [{
 *       "name": "Short Sleeve T-Shirt",
 *       "sku": "",
 *       "quantity": 1,
 *       "grams": 1000,
 *       "price": 1999,
 *       "vendor": "Jamie D's Emporium",
 *       "requires_shipping": true,
 *       "taxable": true,
 *       "fulfillment_service": "manual",
 *       "properties": null,
 *       "product_id": 48447225880,
 *       "variant_id": 258644705304
 *     }],
 *     "currency": "USD",
 *     "locale": "en"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ### Example response
 * ```json
 * {
 *    "rates": [
 *        {
 *            "service_name": "canadapost-overnight",
 *            "service_code": "ON",
 *            "total_price": "1295",
 *            "description": "This is the fastest option by far",
 *            "currency": "CAD",
 *            "min_delivery_date": "2013-04-12 14:48:45 -0400",
 *            "max_delivery_date": "2013-04-12 14:48:45 -0400"
 *        },
 *        {
 *            "service_name": "fedex-2dayground",
 *            "service_code": "2D",
 *            "total_price": "2934",
 *            "currency": "USD",
 *            "min_delivery_date": "2013-04-12 14:48:45 -0400",
 *            "max_delivery_date": "2013-04-12 14:48:45 -0400"
 *        },
 *        {
 *            "service_name": "fedex-priorityovernight",
 *            "service_code": "1D",
 *            "total_price": "3587",
 *            "currency": "USD",
 *            "min_delivery_date": "2013-04-12 14:48:45 -0400",
 *            "max_delivery_date": "2013-04-12 14:48:45 -0400"
 *        }
 *    ]
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * The `address3`, `fax`, `address_type`, and `company_name` fields are returned by
 * specific [ActiveShipping](https://github.com/Shopify/active_shipping) providers.
 * For API-created carrier services, you should use only the following shipping
 * address fields:
 * * `address1`
 * * `address2`
 * * `city`
 * * `zip`
 * * `province`
 * * `country`
 *
 * Other values remain as `null` and are not sent to the callback URL.
 *
 * ### Response fields
 *
 * When Shopify requests shipping rates using your callback URL, the response
 * object `rates` must be a JSON array of objects with the following fields. 
 * Required fields must be included in the response for the carrier service
 * integration to work properly.
 *
 * | Field                   | Required | Description                              
 *                                                                                 
 *                                                                                   |
 * | ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
 * | `service_name`          | Yes      | The name of the rate, which customers see
 * at checkout. For example: `Expedited Mail`.                                     
 *                                                                                   |
 * | `description`           | Yes      | A description of the rate, which
 * customers see at checkout. For example: `Includes tracking and insurance`.      
 *                                                                                            |

 *                                                                                     |
 * | `currency`              | Yes      | The currency of the shipping rate.       
 *                                                                                 
 *                                                                                   |

 * | `phone_required`        | No       | Whether the customer must provide a phone
 * number at checkout.                                                             
 *                                                                                   |
 * | `min_delivery_date`     | No       | The earliest delivery date for the

 *                                                                                          |
 * | `max_delivery_date`     | No       | The latest delivery date for the
 * displayed rate to still be valid.                                               
 *                                                                                            |
 *
 * ### Special conditions
 *
 * * To indicate that this carrier service cannot handle this shipping request,
 * return an empty array and any successful (20x) HTTP code.
 * * To force backup rates instead, return a 40x or 50x HTTP code with any content.
 * A good choice is the regular 404 Not Found code.
 * * Redirects (30x codes) will only be followed for the same domain as the
 * original callback URL. Attempting to redirect to a different domain will trigger backup rates.
 * * There is no retry mechanism. The response must be successful on the first try,
 * within the time budget listed below. Timeouts or errors will trigger backup rates.
 *
 * ## Response Timeouts
 *
 * The read timeout for rate requests are dynamic, based on the number of requests
 * per minute (RPM). These limits are applied to each shop-app pair. The timeout
 * values are as follows.
 *
 * | RPM Range     | Timeout    |
 * | ------------- | ---------- |
 * | Under 1500    | 10s        |
 * | 1500 to 3000  | 5s         |
 * | Over 3000     | 3s         |
 *
 * > Note:
 * > These values are upper limits and should not be interpretted as a goal to
 * develop towards. Shopify is constantly evaluating the performance of the
 * platform and working towards improving resilience as well as app capabilities.
 * As such, these numbers may be adjusted outside of our normal versioning timelines.
 *
 * ## Server-side caching of requests
 * Shopify provides server-side caching to reduce the number of requests it makes.
 * Any shipping rate request that identically matches the following fields will be
 * retrieved from Shopify's cache of the initial response:
 * * variant IDs
 * * default shipping box weight and dimensions
 * * variant quantities
 * * carrier service ID
 * * origin address
 * * destination address
 * * item weights and signatures
 *
 * If any of these fields differ, or if the cache has expired since the original
 * request, then new shipping rates are requested. The cache expires 15 minutes
 * after rates are successfully returned. If an error occurs, then the cache
 * expires after 30 seconds.
