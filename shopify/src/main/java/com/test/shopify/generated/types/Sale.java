/**
 * An individual sale record associated with a sales agreement. Every money value
 * in an order's sales data is represented in the currency's smallest unit. When
 * amounts are divided across multiple line items, such as taxes or order
 * discounts, the amounts might not divide evenly across all of the line items on
 * the order. To address this, the remaining currency units that couldn't be
 * divided evenly are allocated one at a time, starting with the first line item,
 * until they are all accounted for. In aggregate, the values sum up correctly. In
 * isolation, one line item might have a different tax or discount amount than
 * another line item of the same price, before taxes and discounts. This is because
 * the amount could not be divided evenly across the items. The allocation of
 * currency units across line items is immutable. After they are allocated,
 * currency units are never reallocated or redistributed among the line items.
