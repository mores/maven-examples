/**
 * The `DiscountCodeBasic` object lets you manage
 * [amount off discounts](https://help.shopify.com/manual/discounts/discount-types/percentage-fixed-amount)
 * that are applied on a cart and at checkout when a customer enters a code. Amount off discounts give customers a
 * fixed value or a percentage off the products in an order, but don't apply to shipping costs.
 *
 * The `DiscountCodeBasic` object stores information about amount off code discounts that apply to
 * specific [products and variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountProducts),
 * [collections](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountCollections),
 * or [all items in a cart](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AllDiscountItems).
 *
 * Learn more about working with [Shopify's discount model](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/discounts),
 * including limitations and considerations.
 *
 * > Note:
 * > The [`DiscountAutomaticBasic`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountAutomaticBasic)
 * object has similar functionality to the `DiscountCodeBasic` object, but discounts are automatically applied,
 * without the need for customers to enter a code.
