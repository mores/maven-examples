/**
 * Specifies the date when delivery or fulfillment is completed by a merchant for a given time cycle. You can also
 * define a cutoff for which customers are eligible to enter this cycle and the desired behavior for customers who
 * start their subscription inside the cutoff period.
 *
 * Some example scenarios where anchors can be useful to implement advanced delivery behavior:
 * - A merchant starts fulfillment on a specific date every month.
 * - A merchant wants to bill the 1st of every quarter.
 * - A customer expects their delivery every Tuesday.
