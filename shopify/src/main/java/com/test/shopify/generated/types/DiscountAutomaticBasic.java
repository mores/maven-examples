/**
 * The `DiscountAutomaticBasic` object lets you manage
 * [amount off discounts](https://help.shopify.com/manual/discounts/discount-types/percentage-fixed-amount)
 * that are automatically applied on a cart and at checkout. Amount off discounts give customers a
 * fixed value or a percentage off the products in an order, but don't apply to shipping costs.
 *
 * The `DiscountAutomaticBasic` object stores information about automatic amount off discounts that apply to
 * specific [products and variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountProducts),
 * [collections](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountCollections),

 *
 * Learn more about working with [Shopify's discount model](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/discounts),
 * including limitations and considerations.
 *
 * > Note:
 * > The [`DiscountCodeBasic`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountCodeBasic)
 * object has similar functionality to the `DiscountAutomaticBasic` object, but customers need to enter a code to
