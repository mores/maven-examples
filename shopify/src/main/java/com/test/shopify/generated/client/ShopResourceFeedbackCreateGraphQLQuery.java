/**
 * The `ResourceFeedback` object lets your app report the status of shops and their resources. For example, if
 * your app is a marketplace channel, then you can use resource feedback to alert
 * merchants that they need to connect their marketplace account by signing in.
 *   
 * Resource feedback notifications are displayed to the merchant on the home
 * screen of their Shopify admin, and in the product details view for any
 * products that are published to your app.
 *   
 * This resource should be used only in cases where you're describing steps that
 * a merchant is required to complete. If your app offers optional or promotional
 * set-up steps, or if it makes recommendations, then don't use resource feedback
 * to let merchants know about them.
 *   
 * ## Sending feedback on a shop
 *   
 * You can send resource feedback on a shop to let the merchant know what steps
 * they need to take to make sure that your app is set up correctly. Feedback can
 * have one of two states: `requires_action` or `success`. You need to send a
 * `requires_action` feedback request for each step that the merchant is required to complete.
 *   
 * If there are multiple set-up steps that require merchant action, then send
 * feedback with a state of `requires_action` as merchants complete prior steps.
 * And to remove the feedback message from the Shopify admin, send a `success`
 * feedback request.
 *   
 * #### Important
 * Sending feedback replaces previously sent feedback for the shop. Send a new
 * `shopResourceFeedbackCreate` mutation to push the latest state of a shop or
 * its resources to Shopify.
