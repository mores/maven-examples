/**
 * A **Fulfillment Service** is a third party warehouse that prepares and ships orders
 * on behalf of the store owner. Fulfillment services charge a fee to package and ship items
 * and update product inventory levels. Some well known fulfillment services with Shopify integrations
 * include: Amazon, Shipwire, and Rakuten. When an app registers a new `FulfillmentService` on a store,
 * Shopify automatically creates a `Location` that's associated to the fulfillment service.
 * To learn more about fulfillment services, refer to
 * [Manage fulfillments as a fulfillment service app](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps)
 * guide.
 *
 * ## Mutations
 *
 * You can work with the `FulfillmentService` object with the
 * [fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate),
 * [fulfillmentServiceUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceUpdate),
 * and [fulfillmentServiceDelete](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceDelete)
 * mutations.
 *
 * ## Hosted endpoints
 *
 * Fulfillment service providers integrate with Shopify by providing Shopify with a set of hosted endpoints that
 * Shopify can query on certain conditions.
 * These endpoints must have a common prefix, and this prefix should be supplied in the `callbackUrl` parameter
 * in the
 * [fulfillmentServiceCreate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentServiceCreate)
 * mutation.
 *
 * - Shopify sends POST requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fulfillment_order_notification` endpoint
 *   to notify the fulfillment service about fulfillment requests and fulfillment cancellation requests.
 *
 *   For more information, refer to
 *   [Receive fulfillment requests and cancellations](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-2-receive-fulfillment-requests-and-cancellations).
 * - Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_tracking_numbers` endpoint to retrieve tracking numbers for orders,
 *   if `trackingSupport` is set to `true`.
 *
 *   For more information, refer to
 *   [Enable tracking support](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-8-enable-tracking-support-optional).
 *
 *   Fulfillment services can also update tracking information with the
 *   [fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/unstable/mutations/fulfillmentTrackingInfoUpdate) mutation,
 *   rather than waiting for Shopify to ask for tracking numbers.
 * - Shopify sends GET requests to the `<callbackUrl>/fetch_stock` endpoint to retrieve inventory levels,
 *   if `inventoryManagement` is set to `true`.
 *
 *   For more information, refer to
 *   [Sharing inventory levels with Shopify](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#step-9-share-inventory-levels-with-shopify-optional).
 *
 * To make sure you have everything set up correctly, you can test the `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints
 * in your development store.
 *
 * ## Resources and webhooks
 *
 * There are a variety of objects and webhooks that enable a fulfillment service to work.
 * To exchange fulfillment information with Shopify, fulfillment services use the
 * [FulfillmentOrder](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrder),
 * [Fulfillment](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Fulfillment) and
 * [Order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/Order) objects and related mutations.
 * To act on fulfillment process events that happen on the Shopify side,
 * besides awaiting calls to `callbackUrl`-prefixed endpoints,
 * fulfillment services can subscribe to the
 * [fulfillment order](https://shopify.dev/apps/fulfillment/fulfillment-service-apps/manage-fulfillments#webhooks)
 * and [order](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/webhook)
 * webhooks.
