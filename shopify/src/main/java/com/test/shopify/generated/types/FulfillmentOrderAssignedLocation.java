/**
 * The fulfillment order's assigned location. This is the location where the fulfillment is expected to happen.
 *
 *  The fulfillment order's assigned location might change in the following cases:
 *
 *   - The fulfillment order has been entirely moved to a new location. For example, the [fulfillmentOrderMove](
 *     https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderMove
 *     ) mutation has been called, and you see the original fulfillment order in the [movedFulfillmentOrder](
 *     https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderMove#field-fulfillmentordermovepayload-movedfulfillmentorder
 *     ) field within the mutation's response.
 *
 *   - Work on the fulfillment order has not yet begun, which means that the fulfillment order has the
 *       [OPEN](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderStatus#value-open),
 *       [SCHEDULED](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderStatus#value-scheduled), or
 *       [ON_HOLD](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderStatus#value-onhold)
 *       status, and the shop's location properties might be undergoing edits (for example, in the Shopify admin).
 *
 * If the [fulfillmentOrderMove](
 * https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/mutations/fulfillmentOrderMove
 * ) mutation has moved the fulfillment order's line items to a new location,
 * but hasn't moved the fulfillment order instance itself, then the original fulfillment order's assigned location
 * doesn't change.
 * This happens if the fulfillment order is being split during the move, or if all line items can be moved
 * to an existing fulfillment order at a new location.
 *
 * Once the fulfillment order has been taken into work or canceled,
 * which means that the fulfillment order has the
 * [IN_PROGRESS](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderStatus#value-inprogress),
 * [CLOSED](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderStatus#value-closed),
 * [CANCELLED](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderStatus#value-cancelled), or
 * [INCOMPLETE](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/enums/FulfillmentOrderStatus#value-incomplete)
 * status, `FulfillmentOrderAssignedLocation` acts as a snapshot of the shop's location content.
 * Up-to-date shop's location data may be queried through [location](
 *   https://shopify.dev/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/FulfillmentOrderAssignedLocation#field-fulfillmentorderassignedlocation-location
 * ) connection.
