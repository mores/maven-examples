/**
 * A contract between a merchant and a customer to do business. Shopify creates a
 * sales agreement whenever an order is placed, edited, or refunded. A sales
 * agreement has one or more sales records, which provide itemized details about
 * the initial agreement or subsequent changes made to the order. For example, when
 * a customer places an order, Shopify creates the order, generates a sales
 * agreement, and records a sale for each line item purchased in the order. A sale
 * record is specific to a type of order line. Order lines can represent different
 * things such as a purchased product, a tip added by a customer, shipping costs
 * collected at checkout, and more.
