/**
 * The `DiscountAutomaticBxgy` object lets you manage
 * [buy X get Y discounts (BXGY)](https://help.shopify.com/manual/discounts/discount-types/buy-x-get-y)
 * that are automatically applied on a cart and at checkout. BXGY discounts incentivize customers by offering
 * them additional items at a discounted price or for free when they purchase a specified quantity of items.
 *
 * The `DiscountAutomaticBxgy` object stores information about automatic BXGY discounts that apply to
 * specific [products and variants](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountProducts),
 * [collections](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountCollections),
 * or [all items in a cart](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/AllDiscountItems).
 *
 * Learn more about working with [Shopify's discount model](https://shopify.dev/docs/apps/build/discounts),
 * including limitations and considerations.
 *
 * > Note:
 * > The [`DiscountCodeBxgy`](https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/latest/objects/DiscountCodeBxgy)
 * object has similar functionality to the `DiscountAutomaticBxgy` object, but customers need to enter a code to
 * receive a discount.
